MedBot

MedBot is a medical ai that's designed to help those who are in medical need get fast information. It's designed for mobility so that it is easy to get a hold of where ever you go. The microphone function makes so the consumer doesn't need to focus on typing and can just talk to the medical ai. Bigger buttons make it easier for consumers with medical issues to hit. The ai's main priority is you. Ask it for definitions, symptoms, medical news, and ask to call 911 in emergencies. Later features are to come whithin the future, so make sure to stay in touch.
